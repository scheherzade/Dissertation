Abstract
Blaze is a template based high performance C++ math library. Blaze provides four
different backends for parallelization, one of which is HPX - a C++ library for
concurrency and parallelism. Here we are suggesting to use a set of compile-time
and run-time parameters to improve the performance of a Blaze when used with HPX
backend.
